# hugo-book-project
Book publishing project with Hugo

Note: I'm not actually going to republish classic books (only publishing new books) but some chapters of public domain books are included for the example.

Things to change/add/fix:

* Only chapters from a single book are showing up on the front page
* Add way to disable breadcrumbs on a page
* Featured can be static
* List should be a list of books, it can also be static

???

* For example, instead of Draculas in the breadcrumbs it should say Dracula, stop adding the extra s (just notice this seems to be fixed simply by adding an _index.html with the title Dracula so may not be an actual issue)
* Tags are not working fully properly (actually with this project they appear to be working proplery so ??? for now, I must have something wrong set in my other project)
