This site is a book project.

This example was made for the [Tarot.io](https://www.tarot.io/) free online library. With this example, you can make your own free online library too!

## Freedom

Freedom of the press is about you and me having the freedom to say, make, publish, and distribute any speech we want. Freedom of the press does not mean that mega-corporations have the right to blast us with propaganda 24/7 meant to bend us to their will while we don't even have the freedom to respond.

Reject the idea that only a special class has the right to speak freely.

Take back YOUR freedom of the press today!
